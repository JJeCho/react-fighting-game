## About the Project

Free Sprite Fighter is an experimental fighting game where all characters are crafted from freely available sprites and assets found online. Unlike traditional games that rely on a game engine like Phaser, this project leverages **React** to manage the game loop and **GSAP** for smooth animations. The game allows players to pit various free sprite characters against one another to determine the ultimate champion of free sprites.

## Features

- **React-based Game Loop**: The entire game runs using a custom game loop built with React, showcasing the flexibility and performance of React for game development.
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth animations are powered by GSAP, providing dynamic and fluid character movements and attacks.
- **Free Sprite Characters**: All characters are sourced from free assets, giving life to various sprites and letting players choose their favorite.
